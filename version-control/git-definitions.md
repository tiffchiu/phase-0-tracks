# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a way to track changes over time so that you could revisit or roll back specific versions at another time. It is useful because it allows you to have a backup if you ever need to roll something back or revisit something you did a previous time.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is essentially another timeline. It is a copy of a particular file and allows you to make changes and continue on that path before you decide whether to merge it back into the master or to discard it. It is used to keep the master branch clean, so that you are able to work on features without fear of breaking the entire project. It is also a good way for multiple developers to work on different features of the same project simultaneously.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit publishes what you have written and staged to the repository. A good commit message should be clear and direct in what the new or edited code is meant to do.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when two separate branches have made the same changes on the same section of the same file. When Git is unable to determine which change should be used, a merge conflict occurs.
