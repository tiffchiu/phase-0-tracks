What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
- Semantic tags are used to provide meaning to the content. They are also used in accessibility to give context to those who are not consuming the information visually. I think marking the <main> section is useful as well as clearly displaying the <nav> tags.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
- The elements are displayed from top to bottom.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
- I learned that Sublime has a lot more capabilities that I was originally aware of. I think I would definitely create snippets for use in the future.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
- While I understand the concept of semantic tags, it was difficult for me to remember to include them. After this exercise, it reminded me of its importance as well as how to implement them.
