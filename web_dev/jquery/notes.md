## Study Plan

*Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.*

Since there is a limited amount of time for learning, my best course of action would be to find some sort of overview to get a better sense from what jQuery is on a high level, and then finding and exploring some of the documentation on what it can do. Taking breaks and making sure to test ideas will be important to make sure what I read has actually sunk in.


## Study Results

Working through a few examples and tutorials proved to be the most effective. Since the concepts were not *totally* foreign, it was more a matter of how to execute.
